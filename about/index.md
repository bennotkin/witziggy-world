About Witziggy World.

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my personal website. I write about the ampersand between policy design and policy delivery â€” yes, the ampersand. You know, where the idea in a backroom translates into life outside of an office, where best practices research meets the complexities of the everyday, where questions involve who gets to make decisions and with what resources and knowledge; the permutations of the ampersand abound, and I am here to reflect on them all.

As always, the best part of this page is the conversation it spurs with you all. Feel free to contact me at kyle.witzigman@gmail.com while my page's email is getting set up. Look around at some past content and let me know whether there is any future content you would like to see me ruminate on!

Cheers.
