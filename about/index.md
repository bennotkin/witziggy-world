# Hey there!
Thanks for checking out Witziggy World, my personal website.

I write about the ampersand between policy design and policy delivery â€” yes, the ampersand. You know, where the idea in a backroom translates into life outside of an office, where best practices research meets the complexities of the everyday, where questions involve who gets to make decisions and with what resources and knowledge; the permutations of the ampersand abound, and I am here to reflect on them all.

Cheers.
