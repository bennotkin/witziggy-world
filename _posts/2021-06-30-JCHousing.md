The [Joint Center for Housing Studies](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/) combines public policy, urban planning, and public outreach to inform policy on housing issues. It addresses perspectives from government, from business, and from civic actors who have a say in housing policy's future.

- For example, in this post on affordable housing policy changes in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/what-can-we-expect-cambridges-new-affordable-housing-overlay), Andrew Gibbs looks at the intersections of affordable housing and real estate capital markets. His piece explores a new housing overlay policy to attempt to add more affordable housing with explanations on what has not been accomplished with the new policy.

- For another example, Sharon Cornelissen researched how [different historical experiences shapes street life](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/how-histories-neighborhood-violence-and-privilege-shape-street-life-insights-brightmoor) in the Brightmoor neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan.

The Joint Center's work looks at housing markets and rental conditions as well as ownership, aging, demographics, and affordability. Give them a read through.
