The Joint Center for Housing Studies combines public policy, urban planning, and public outreach to inform policy on housing issues. It addresses perspectives from government, from business, and from civic actors who have a say in housing policy's future.

For example, in this post on affordable housing policy changes in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/what-can-we-expect-cambridges-new-affordable-housing-overlay), Andrew Gibbs looks at the intersections of affordable housing and real estate capital markets. His piece explores a new housing overlay policy to attempt to add more affordable housing with explanations on what has not been accomplished with the new policy.

The Joint Center's work looks at housing markets and rental conditions as well as ownership, aging, demographics, and affordability. Give them a read through.
