You should have received an email inviting you to collaborate on Github with me on the "repository" (read: project) for this site: bennotkin/witziggy-world. Go ahead and accept the invitation so you have can add and edit posts.

## 1. Setting up Github
Go ahead and download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (or you can use the command line ‚Äì if you'd prefer that route let me know). This will give you a graphical user interface to upload and manage your files/posts. You'll need to add your github username and email address.

You may also want to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (or other) as a text editor. You can also just use macOS's TextEdit but VS Code has some helpful features, like showing all the files in a folder from within the text editor.

Once you're logged in to Github Desktop you should see your repositories, including `witziggy-world`. Following the on screen directions, choose to save the repository on your computer. You won't need to touch most of the files in this repository but you need to have them on your computer so you can add new ones. 

Now you have a version of the website on your computer. The site isn't hosted on your computer, but your computer has a mirrored copy of the files. (From the perspective of your computer, the version online is called "origin".) To add (or remove) anything to the website you'll first add them to this directory. Later you will "push" this directory online.

### How does Github work?
We don't need to understand much about Github and Git to use it as free hosting for this project, but a little bit of knowledge is helpful. First, Github is an organization and platform, and Git is technology/program ‚Äì okay, tbh I don't really know what to call Git, but it's a tool that allows people to work together on a project and track versions of the project.

There are much better explanations online, but Git is a system of "forks" and "branches". (Sorry if you already know all this! And sorry*2 if I'm getting it wrong.) You begin with a main (or master) branch, which is basically the most official version of the project. People make branches¬†‚Äì essentially linked copies ‚Äì of this main branch to work on. When people are happy with the changes they've made to the branch, they can merge the changes into the main branch.

On your computer you more or less have a branch of the site (technically it's a "clone" ‚Äì I'm not sure whether this is officially considered a branch, but it operates the same way). You'll be adding posts to this branch, and then when you want to go live with your changes you'll "commit" the changes (bottom left of Github Desktop) and then "push" them to "origin" (center of Github Desktop). If this doesn't work you may need to update your local branch to match "origin". To do so, click fetch on the top of the window, and then pull. 

Okay, enough Github talk.

## 2. Adding a post

### What is Jekyll?
Again, it's not important to know all the underlying details, but let's take a brief look under the hood so you know what's going on. I made this site using Jekyll, which is a "static site generator". As I understand it, most websites (or at least websites with articles or posts) today are re-made whenever a user visits the website. All of the content exists in an online database, and when a person visits the site, the relevant pieces of content get called into action and put into place.

I don't know why this is the norm ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but it's complicated and inefficient. It's probably really important for some use cases (like maybe algorithmically chosen user-specifc content?). Witziggy World is not that use case, so we get to take advantage of a much simpler set up: the static site generator. (We're using Jekyll but others, like Hugo, also exist. To host for free on Github Pages, Jekyll is the one to use.) A static site generator gets "built" ‚Äì ie. all the content gets stitched together into html and css files ‚Äì when the site owner is ready to deploy, and then it sits in that form until the owner adds, edits or deletes a file. On Github, whenever you push changes to the main branch, the site gets built.

But what do I mean by building? Jekyll takes a set of piecemeal files and assembles them into a coherent whole that renders as a website. In your directory right now, you have markdown files (this is a markdown file), layouts, and data files. This isn't super important. All that matters for you right now is that you write markdown files, and then using layouts I'm building, Jekyll turns that markdown into html.

### How to actually post something
1. **Create a new file** in the `_posts` folder in the repository folder on your computer. (It's easy to create an empty file inside the folder from within VS Code: right click the `_posts` folder and select `New File`. You can also just make a new file in TextEdit and then save it in the `_posts` folder.)
2. **Name the file** in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, where the first half is the date you want the post to look like it was posted: for example, this post is saved as `2021-02-28-Welcome.md`. (If you're interested in a simple program that automatically inserts today's date when you type `:date` I can talk to you about [espanso](espanso.org).)
3. **Add "front matter".** Every post or page needs information for how Jekyll should build it. You tell Jekyll what the page title is, the date it should be/look posted, the layout to use, and any other relevant variables. This front matter goes between a sandwich of three dashed lines. See below.
4. **Write your content.** Below the front matter, you write your content. You can include images (a tad more difficult than simply pasting in: drop the image file into the assets/images folder, and then type `![placeholder text or nothing]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg)`). (That `{{site.baseurl }}` is literal, just type that in directly. It's a bit messy I know ‚Äì I'm looking if it can be more elegant)
5. **Save your file.** 
6. **Commit & push online** using Github Desktop.

### Front matter
At the start of any post you need to include the following
```
---
title: The title you want displayed
date: 2021-03-01 (important to match date in filename)
category: which category does it belong to?
layout: post # this tells Jekyll how to format the page
longtitle: The title, formatted in html, see note
author: author of post, optional
---
```

The top of this page looks like 

```
---
title: Welcome to this Github hosted site
longtitle: | 
    <p>WELCOME <i>to this</i></p>
    <p>GITHUB HOSTED SITE</p>
date: 2021-02-28
layout: post
category: Setting everything up
---

You should have received an email inviting you ...
```

The longtitle is how we can create a title with some more interesting formatting, like at the top of this page. The `<p>` and `</p>` mark the beginning and end of each line; the `<i>` and `</i>` mark the beginning and end of italics. I've set it up so each line should alternate which side it aligns to. We can talk more about this.

### That's a lot I know.
This might be looking very complicated and unnecessary. Go through the process twice, though, and I think it should feel really easy. I probably gave you simulutaneously more and less information than you needed ‚Äì so we can talk this over more.

For now, though, I hope this helps üòä
