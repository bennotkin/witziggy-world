In January of this year, I went on an adventure - as much as an adventure as can be had in a pandemic and the suburbs of Arkansas: I decided to try vegetarianism.

When I spoke about trying vegetarianism, people's reactions around me signaled shame or guilt. I heard lines on "I'm trying to eat less meat" or "We only eat out once every few days" to "We've thought about composting more of our food that is leftover." No person was commenting on the relative benefits of abstaining from meat. Rather, it seemed external, social forces had pre-determined that this conversation would consist of guilt, shame, and blame.

Enter: [Eating Animals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FOR2OJO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

Safran Foer's work explores the arguments for both sides empathetically. With anecdotes and wit, he asks why he can look at his dog and see a friend, but look at a chicken or pig and see food. He asks, "What philosophical arguments draw the line of different communities' interpretations on what goes on the table and what gets fed under the table?"

Safran Foer depicts the gross conditions that govern current-day meat production: the genetic manipulation of animals we eventually slaughter, the horrible conditions they are raised in, and the gruesome ways in which we kill to package meat that ends up at the grocery store. His book is cringe-inducing at times.

The deep dive into the specifics of food production is notable. Safran Foer goes a step further to look at how this industry is also influencing the policy surrounding its welfare. At times, his tone is one of wonder and awe. At other times, it is of dismay, shock, and disgust.

Foer - while claiming this book is not about advocating for vegetarianism - is appalled at the treatment of animals and the systems built to put food on the table.

This is where the philosophical tension lies in his work. The premise unspoken goes unsubstantiated and comes into conflict for the potential reader. If you believe animals are equal in nature to humans, then you'll find Safran Foer's work affirming. For those who believe humans are innately different and higher in a hierarchy than other creatures on earth, then you will find his work specious.

I should let you know that I lasted twenty-two days in my vegetarianism quest. Over time, I appreciated the variety of protein sources I could find, the taste of roasted vegetables, and the mixture and medlies that I can create in seasoned stews. Yet, I also appreciated my greasy burger on Day 23.

Safran Foer's work holds true on one end: We must understand our industries better and find a deeper connection to the process of how these animals start on a factory farm and end up on our tables. Our philosophical premise - that a meal <i>must</i> include meat - is worth interrogating. Shouldn't we be able to enjoy a meal free of meat just as much as we would a meal with meat?

In the near term, I'll research more about my own supply chains for the food I'm consuming and whether there's a community agricultural initiative nearby.
