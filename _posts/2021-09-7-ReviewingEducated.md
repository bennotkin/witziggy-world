Tara Westover's [Educated](https://www.amazon.com/Educated-Memoir-Tara-Westover/dp/0399590501) reflects on uncertainty, power, independence, identity, and how education and a broadening world view can affect all of these areas.

Westover grew up in a survivalist household in Idaho preparing for the end of the world. She would first step foot in a classroom at the age of 17. Her curiosity would lead her to Brigham Young University, Harvard, and Cambridge. Yet, the empowerment she felt from education came with feeling farther and farther removed from her family whom she still loved.

The empowerment, awareness, and self-discovery that come with increased learning are at the heart of the book. Westover turned her education into a chance at self-invention/finding-herself that left room for her to contemplate an increased world view and reflect on the relationship she wanted with her family.
