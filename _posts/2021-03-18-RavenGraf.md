<i>[Raven Graf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raven-graf-337507132/) (they/them) is an activist, volunteer for the [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/), board member of [Our Climate](https://ourclimate.us/), and recipient of the Switzer Fellowship. They graduated from Swarthmore College with degrees in biology and chemistry and received a Master in Public Policy from Harvard Kennedy School of Government.</i>

<i>In this conversation, they describe our current climate challenges and advocate for climate legislation to change the world's current climate trajectory.</i>

<i>A summary of the conversation is provided below.</i>

## Climate Trajectory in Context
Raven illustrated how our challenges with climate range from rising temperatures and heat concerns to famine, drought, and floods. Current assumptions about the climate from the Middle East and North Africa to the American Southwest in Texas show that volatile weather changes can wreak havock in unprepared communities, they explained.

> "We have to tackle all these crises at the same time, and they don't have to be in competition... Solving any of one of these problems can help achieve progress in all of them."

Climate change is going to mean food and water scarcity and conflicts over the remaining resources, they continued.

"All of those are going to cause mass displacement of communities in order of magnitude larger than current refugee flows," Raven said. 

They concluded that to avoid the worst impacts, we must act now.

Additionally, they caveated that climate action should be undertaken with a range of changes - fixing democracy, building a racially just society, improving healthcare, repairing education, and managing a pandemic response. Framing climate as the biggest or most important, Raven cautioned, there's always an implication that other work is less important.

"We have to tackle all these crises at the same time, and they don't have to be in competition... Solving any of one of these problems can help achieve progress in all of them," Raven said.

## Urgent Action Now
### The climate landscape
In addition to heat events, Raven described other effects from climate change: Ocean acidification, mass extinction of species, plagues contained in animals that are melting from permafrost.

### The political landscape
The Biden Administration has released a social cost of carbon to frame the tradeoff of costs and benefits of continuing to produce carbon emissions versus other sources of energy. The social cost of carbon is one way of framing the tradeoff of effort, time, and resources used to reduce the carbon emissions from specific industries or geographies. The social cost of carbon is one way to frame zero-carbon alternatives as cost-competitive, Raven said.

Raven warned there are limitations and assumptions to consider in the social cost of carbon calculations. The <i>discount rate</i> of how we care about what happens tomorrow versus what happens in twenty years changes in the calculations. Furthermore, the impact of climate may differ, and how we relate climate assumptions into GDP and economic wellbeing is based on that set of assumptions.

Even with the assumptions present, Raven insists we still know we need to mitigate environmental impacts coming from our production and consumption. They explained that there is a generally agreed upon figure - 2 degree celsius of warming - that we need to keep our planet under to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

### Dramatically Transform Five Systems
According to Raven, there are five intertwined systems we should think about transforming to address climate concerns: Electricity, Transportation, Heating and Cooling, Industrial, and Food systems.

These interact in complicated ways, Raven acknowledged. At a high level, they offered a two-step approach to reducing carbon emissions: Step one is to de-carbonize electricity and step two is to electrify everything. Cars should become electric. Heat pumps need to switch to electricity from fossil fuels. Other initiatives should be taken to move towards a carbon-free economy.

At one level, this is all conceptual. At a lower level, this becomes tangible and the concern becomes how to implement. Raven explained that 700 policies have been identified in the United States to stem climate disaster. Each policy is a substantial starting point to address step one and step two, Raven detailed.

## Taking Action in Our Own Lives
On a broad level, Raven supports social activism.

"I am banking on the power of social movements," Raven said. "Social movements have an enormous ability to change the landscape on which elected officials are acting."

Raven described Bill Moyer's work on Doing Democracy to illustrate different roles in which people coordinate to create social change: People who help, people who advocate for change in power structures, people who rebel to highlight the urgency and current crisis, and people who organize and makes information digestible and accessible to the broader public. Raven explained that all four roles are needed in a movement, but they often are not coordinated.

At a personal level, Raven urged us to find local community groups making change. They believe a beautiful aspect of the broader social movements is plugging into local organizations and build relationships. On a national level, there are groups that have chapters throughout the country you can get involved in.

For Raven, social movement mobilization may be the way forward to mitigate climate disaster.

"We can all find our niche in that broader system and support others who are taking different strategies," Raven said. "This is where the fun part comes in."
